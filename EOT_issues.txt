I dont know if EOT is working or if it is being weird.. i targeted the model to classify class 22 to class 1 but it classifies it to class 27?? 

Why is the perturbed image in green , idk ? if we color correct it , will the model be fooled?

Increasing the number of iterations just makes the thing undetectable.. how do we increase the confidence of wrong class?

IDKKKK , i tried everything _/|\_
